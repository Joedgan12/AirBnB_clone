# AirBnB Clone - The Console

The goal of this project is to deploy a simple AirBnB clone on a server.
The console is the first segment of the project. It is a shell program on which users (backend developers) use to validate the backend logic. It will act as our frontend and a tool to validate the storage engine. It will be primarily used to: 
    * Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    * Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
    * Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    * Update attributes of an object
    * Destroy an object
